# Hi there, I'm Mohammedamin 👋

I'm a self-taught software developer passionate about coding and technology. Currently, I'm focusing on full-stack development and working on projects that challenge me to grow and improve. I'm always excited to learn new things and build functional and creative applications.

## 🚀 What I'm Learning:
- 🌱 I'm currently diving deep into **Full Stack Development**, building projects from scratch to sharpen my skills.
- 🎯 My goal is to expand my expertise in both front-end and back-end technologies to create more complex applications.

## 💻 Featured Project:
### [Rock Paper Scissors Game](https://github.com/mamine27/rock-paper-scissors)
My first functional website, built from scratch using:
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the front-end.
- Integrated **GIFs** for interactive visual feedback.
